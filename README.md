#### Work in Progress

#### 
Initially conceived as a challenge in our Algorithm and
Parallel Computing course, this projectâ€™s goal was to compute the maximum and minimum
eigenvalues of a matrix using the Power Iteration method in C++. Motivated by the
importance of eigenvalues in numerical linear algebra, Leo Marzioli 
and I expanded the
scope to compute all eigenvalues, delving into both object-oriented programming and
advanced numerical techniques comparing a random approach to a deterministic one
